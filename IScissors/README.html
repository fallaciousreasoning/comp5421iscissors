<h1>COMP 5421 Assignment 1</h1>

<p>
	To run the program, double click on the 'IScissors.exe' file.
</p>

<p>
	Note: This project was written in C# using the MonoGame framework and as such, it requires the .NET 4.0 framework to be installed. It can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-hk/download/details.aspx?id=40779">here</a>.
	<br/>
	If the framework is not installed the program will fail to run. The framework is often installed with Visual Studio.
</p>

<p>	
	Note: As I am not an undergraduate student, I am not able to create a website at http://www.cse.ust.hk/~yourlogin/5421/iscissor/index.html, so I have one <a href="http://ihome.ust.hk/~joharris/index.html">here</a>
</p>

<p>
	Note: A minimum of three points has been enforced before you can close the contour
</p>

<p>
	The images 'Avatar' and 'Lenna' along with some other choice images can be found in the 'Content' folder next to the executable.
</p>

<p>
	The project has all the basic requirements specified in the grading sheets. However, there are a couple of problems with it, that I feel worth mentioning. <br/><br/>Firstly, I wrote my own simple masking algorithm, as I didn't feel like using some third party library for what was a relatively small part of the project. The algorithm works as follows:
	<ul>
		<li>For each point on the contour, color the pixel in the result image</li>
		<li>Find the minimum point on the contour</li>
		<li>Go up from this point till you find a blank pixel. This pixel must be inside the contour</li>
		<li>Find all pixels with a depth first search that aren't colored and set them to the color in the original image. This is similar to paints 'fill' tool. </li>
	</ul>
	This works perfectly well unless the user defines a complex polygon (that is, a polygon that intersects itself), in which case only one of the areas of the polygon will be filled. For the purposes of this assignment I consider it adequate, as the focus is on the intelligent scissors algorithm.
</p>

<p>
	<h2>Basic Use</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Select 'Action->Start' to begin tracing the contour</li>
		<li>Select 'Action->Stop' to pause</li>
		<li>Select 'Action->Close' to close a contour or simply click on the first point</li>
		<li>If you make a mistake you can undo with 'Edit-Undo'</li>
		<li>You can reset the view or manually set the zoom level from the view menu</li>
		<li>You can set the image mode to Default, Cost, Pixel or Sobel from the view menu</li>
		<li>You can open a new image, clear the contour, save the contour or save an image mask from the file menu</li>
		<li>Use the '+' and '-' buttons to zoom in and out</li>
		<li>Right click and drag anywhere on the screen to pan around</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>
	The project also implements some of the bells and whistles mentioned in the marking sheet. They are as follows:

	<ul>
		<li>
			Optional blurring of the image. The user can add a Gaussian blur to the image with a radius between 1 and 10 (setting the radius to 0 removes the blur). The blur uses a sigma value of 1.4 and this cannot be changed through the UI.

			The main impact of the blur is that it reduces the impact of noise on the intelligent scissors program. At low levels, this means the program is less likely to snap to some non-existent edges. However, as the zoom gets higher, some real edges may get ignored, causing the scissors to only snap to the most pronounced edges. It is for this reason that the program has had its max zoom set to 10.
		</li>
	</ul>
