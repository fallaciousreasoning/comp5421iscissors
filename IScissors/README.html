<h1>COMP 5421 Assignment 1</h1>

<p>
	The project has all the basic requirements specified in the grading sheets. However, there are a couple of problems with it, that I feel worth mentioning. <br/><br/>Firstly, I wrote my own simple masking algorithm, as I didn't feel like using some third party library for what was a relatively small part of the project. The algorithm works as follows:
	<ul>
		<li>For each point on the contour, color the pixel in the result image</li>
		<li>Find the minimum point on the contour</li>
		<li>Go up from this point till you find a blank pixel. This pixel must be inside the contour</li>
		<li>Find all pixels with a depth first search that aren't colored and set them to the color in the original image. This is similar to paints 'fill' tool. </li>
	</ul>
	This works perfectly well unless the user defines a complex polygon (that is, a polygon that intersects itself), in which case only one of the areas of the polygon will be filled. For the purposes of this assignment I consider it adequate, as the focus is on the intelligent scissors algorithm.
</p>

<p>
	The project also implements some of the bells and whistles mentioned in the marking sheet. They are as follows:

	<ul>
		<li>
			Optional blurring of the image. The user can add a Gaussian blur to the image with a radius between 1 and 10 (setting the radius to 0 removes the blur). The blur uses a sigma value of 1.4 and this cannot be changed through the UI.

			The main impact of the blur is that it reduces the impact of noise on the intelligent scissors program. At low levels, this means the program is less likely to snap to some non-existent edges. However, as the zoom gets higher, some real edges may get ignored, causing the scissors to only snap to the most pronounced edges. It is for this reason that the program has had its max zoom set to 10.
		</li>
	</ul>
